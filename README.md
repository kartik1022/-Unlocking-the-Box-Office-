" A Predictive Analysis of Movie Revenue"
"Box Office Breakdown: Analyzing the Revenue to Cost Ratio of Popular Movies" is a project that focuses on analyzing the revenue to cost ratio of popular movies. The project aims to identify which movies are the most profitable by comparing their total box office revenue to their production costs.

The project will involve data collection from various sources such as Box Office Mojo and IMDb, and data preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, filtering, and feature engineering will be applied to the collected data. The selected features will be used to calculate the revenue to cost ratio of each movie.

The project aims to provide insights into the profitability of popular movies and identify trends and patterns that contribute to their success. It can be useful for movie production companies, investors, and distributors in making informed decisions about movie investments and identifying potentially profitable movies.
